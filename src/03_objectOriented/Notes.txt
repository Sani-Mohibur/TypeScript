4 Pillars of OOP: 
    1.Encapsulation 
    2.Abstraction
        Abstraction effectively splits code into two parts:
        The Idea (Abstract): What the object should do (e.g., "Make Sound").
        The Implementation (Concrete): How the object actually does it (e.g., "Bark" or "Meow"). 
    3.Inheritance 
    4.Polymorphism - having many forms 
        Definition: The ability of an object to take on multiple forms. 
        This allows different classes to have methods with the same name but different implementations. 



Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in TypeScript is a way to structure your code using classes, objects, and methods. 
TypeScript adds strong typing on top of JavaScript, allowing you to define properties, 
access modifiers (private, protected, public), and constructors inside classes. 
You create a class as a blueprint, and objects are created from that blueprint. 
With OOP, you can organize code better, reuse logic with inheritance, hide sensitive data with encapsulation, 
and override methods for flexible behavior through polymorphism.
